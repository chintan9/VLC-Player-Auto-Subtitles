Automatically download subtitles in VLC player

You can write VideoLAN VLC player's extensions in LUA programming language. Extensions are in Videolan\VLC directory lua\extensions. 

This is a modified extension to automatically download subtitles. 


IMPORTANT:
*Only works up to version 2.0.8.*
Due to undocumented changes in VLC 2.1.x, the subtitle loading function is broken (forced relative path).

Will add more languages upon request.
Currently this extension is intended for personal use.
